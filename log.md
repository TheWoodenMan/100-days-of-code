# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 16, 2022
##### 
**Today's Progress**: Finished Guess the Number Project, last commit to github done and project made project.
Moving on to the next exercise which is about modal windows operated by buttons which change class using 
document.querySelector and eventlisteners. 

**Thoughts:** 
Most of the debug mistakes I am making came down to class/id symbol being dropped or simply bracket mis-alignments.
I am getting more confident in calling the DOM though and have a few good ideas for future projects and/or updating
the guess the number project beyond the basic requirements.

I need to implement the modal window changes to a project for me to really remember how it works, if the JS course doesn't
do that, I'm going to adapt one of the freecodeacademy projects I finished to do it instead.

### Day 2: March 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
1. I completed 2 pages of the 30 days of JavaScript, primarily as revision but also because I've realised that different developers and tutors put different emphasis on coding fundamentals, or have different projects or exercises which will help me with knowledge retention. I can skip the parts I know and focus on the extra detail.  the 30 days course is very comprehensive and as it's in written format, it's easy to digest quickly. 
2. I completed the ES6 Section of basic Javascript - freecodecamp , learning more about the uses of const/var, arrow functions, default parameters, rest parameter, spread operator, destructuring assignment, Template literal, class syntax, getters and setters, export/import function, promise functions, resolving promises with result/catch,


**Thoughts**

There are a bunch of math/string options that haven't really been properly explored yet. it's worth knowing that in future so I can simply look them up if needed.

I'm currently alternating my learning between three main sources, **jonas.io Complete Javascript Bootcamp** which has already covered the fundamentals and is now project based which is good but it's quite carefully led, **freecodecamp** which tends to be heavily scripted, fairly technical and rigid - but very challenging. and **30 Days of Javascript** which is text based, but very well explained, the exercises at the end let you practice what you need to learn but it's fluid and free-form.

I've come to the conclusion that I learn less from freecodecamp than I do when im writing my own code examples. freecodecamp has good detail but it feels more like 
"crossword puzzle" style challenges that need to be solved so you can pass to the next, I need practical application to really learn and remember. There is a lot of great content in there however and it's structured in a sensible, methodical way that builds up over time. I need to devise projects that implement the code structures I learned in freecodecamp JS ES6 - I feel like I have good awareness but not aptitude yet - I need more direct experience.

I much prefer working with visual studio code, it is intuitive and keeps me on the right path 99% of the time.

### Day 3: March 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
1. Finished the L3 exercises in Day 2 and started Day 3 of 30 Days of JavaScript
2. started the Regular Expressions (regex) part of freecodecamp, I will work my way through this but it's unlikely i'll finish today.
3. I started reading "the javascript way" as revision on the recommendation of a fellow 100 days student :) it reads well and gets straight to the point which I like a lot.

**Thoughts**

1. Day 2 of 30 days was good because it covered things I haven't seen yet, but day 3 seems like mostly maths, boolean and operators that i've seen before. I'll skim through and skip to the exercises and try to do them blind as a challenge. confirm() was new, time functions were also new to me.
2. Most of the exercises were ok, I had to backtrack and check time functions because they're new to me. I am actually good on writing conditional functions on the fly now, I just need to make sure I alternate between arrow functions, ternary operators and different variations on things in general so I can diversify my range a bit and not just fall into the same functions all the time.

### Day 4: March 19, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
1. Completed the regular expressions section of freecodecamp, this was quite difficult!
2. Finished the exercises at the end of day 3 for 30 days of JS which were quite easy - I'm getting good at functions!
3. Started debugging section of freecodecamp.

**Thoughts**
1. it's good to have worked through reg expressions in a methodical way, I understand the syntax now but maybe dont see how I could use this usefully yet.
2. the "restrict possible usernames" problem on freecodecamp is currently blowing my mind, and from the comments I can see Im not the only one. I am 99% done and determined not to look up spoilers! haha i did it!

<code>let username = "JackOfAllTrades";</code><br/>
<code>let userCheck = /^[a-z]+([a-z]+|[\d][\d]+)\d*$/i; // Change this line</code></br>
<code>let result = userCheck.test(username);</code></br>

3. I have a little experience at debugging already from the jonas.io bootcamp and I quite enjoy it. Looking forward to seeing how freecodecamp recommend you do it.
4. practical applications of regex are more apparent now, restricting usernames and passwords for example, already in use all over the world. The ability to extract only the information you need, there are a few good excel projects i've worked on that would love the specificity of that function.
5. i'm getting curious about some of the various frameworks attached to JS, react.js and vue.js for example. I'm interested in how these can enhance the already quite fluid functionality.
6. I need to revise time operations, I still don't 100% understand the maths of it, unix time and formatting for example.

7. Repeating capture groups really kicked my ass to be honest, I found the syntax kind of unintuitive initially, but honestly it's completely logical, and whenever I looked up a solution it was always totall understandable. I will keep going on this and need to explore the exact definitions more to gain aptitude on it.

### Day 5: March 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
1. Started codewars - Worked through some of the introductory challenges and graded in at X kyu.

**Thoughts**
1. I picked up more JS than I realised, when presented with a problem, I have been able to leverage quite a few different techniques and to come at the problem from different angles if needed.
2. If i'm rushed or interrupted for any reason, family or w/e I make more mistakes
