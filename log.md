# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 16, 2022
##### 
**Today's Progress**: Finished Guess the Number Project, last commit to github done and project made project.
Moving on to the next exercise which is about modal windows operated by buttons which change class using 
document.querySelector and eventlisteners. 

**Thoughts:** 
Most of the debug mistakes I am making came down to class/id symbol being dropped or simply bracket mis-alignments.
I am getting more confident in calling the DOM though and have a few good ideas for future projects and/or updating
the guess the number project beyond the basic requirements.

I need to implement the modal window changes to a project for me to really remember how it works, if the JS course doesn't
do that, I'm going to adapt one of the freecodeacademy projects I finished to do it instead.

### Day 2: March 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
1. I completed 2 pages of the 30 days of JavaScript, primarily as revision but also because I've realised that different developers and tutors put different emphasis on coding fundamentals, or have different projects or exercises which will help me with knowledge retention. I can skip the parts I know and focus on the extra detail.  the 30 days course is very comprehensive and as it's in written format, it's easy to digest quickly. 
2. I completed the ES6 Section of basic Javascript - freecodecamp , learning more about the uses of const/var, arrow functions, default parameters, rest parameter, spread operator, destructuring assignment, Template literal, class syntax, getters and setters, export/import function, promise functions, resolving promises with result/catch,


**Thoughts**

There are a bunch of math/string options that haven't really been properly explored yet. it's worth knowing that in future so I can simply look them up if needed.

I'm currently alternating my learning between three main sources, **jonas.io Complete Javascript Bootcamp** which has already covered the fundamentals and is now project based which is good but it's quite carefully led, **freecodecamp** which tends to be heavily scripted, fairly technical and rigid - but very challenging. and **30 Days of Javascript** which is text based, but very well explained, the exercises at the end let you practice what you need to learn but it's fluid and free-form.

I've come to the conclusion that I learn less from freecodecamp than I do when im writing my own code examples. freecodecamp has good detail but it feels more like 
"crossword puzzle" style challenges that need to be solved so you can pass to the next, I need practical application to really learn and remember. There is a lot of great content in there however and it's structured in a sensible, methodical way that builds up over time. I need to devise projects that implement the code structures I learned in freecodecamp JS ES6 - I feel like I have good awareness but not aptitude yet - I need more direct experience.

I much prefer working with visual studio code, it is intuitive and keeps me on the right path 99% of the time.
