# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 16, 2022
##### 
**Today's Progress**: Finished Guess the Number Project, last commit to github done and project made project.
Moving on to 

**Thoughts:** 
Most of the debug mistakes I am making came down to class/id symbol being dropped or simply bracket mis-alignments.
I am getting more confident in calling the DOM though and have a few good ideas for future projects and/or updating
the guess the number project beyond the basic requirements.
