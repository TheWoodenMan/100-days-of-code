# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 16, 2022
##### 
**Today's Progress**: Finished Guess the Number Project, last commit to github done and project made project.
Moving on to the next exercise which is about modal windows operated by buttons which change class using 
document.querySelector and eventlisteners. 

**Thoughts:** 
Most of the debug mistakes I am making came down to class/id symbol being dropped or simply bracket mis-alignments.
I am getting more confident in calling the DOM though and have a few good ideas for future projects and/or updating
the guess the number project beyond the basic requirements.

I need to implement the modal window changes to a project for me to really remember how it works, if the JS course doesn't
do that, I'm going to adapt one of the freecodeacademy projects I finished to do it instead.
